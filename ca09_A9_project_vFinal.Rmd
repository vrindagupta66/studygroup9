# Executive summary

We have chosen Copenhagen as our city. Based on the analysis of the data set we conclude that the best predictors of AirBnB prices for a 4 night stay for 2 people in Copenhagen are:

1.  Type of property – *the bigger and more private the property is the higher the price*
2.  Number of reviews and review scores – *this is used as a proxy for the quality of the property as the higher the number of review and ratings the better the quality of the property*
3.  Number of people the property accommodates – *properties that accommodate more people tend to have higher prices*
4.  Neighborhood the property is located – *more exclusive/ suburbs with properties located near the city have higher prices compared to others*
5.  Availability of the property in the next 30 days – *properties available within the next 30 days tend to cost more as it is assumed the person is willing to pay more as the trip was likely booked without planning whereas more than 30 days the person is usually flexible and will likely look for bargains before booking*
6.  Reviews per month - *Property which has more reviews tend to have a lower price, this may because some negative reviews may affect the reputation of the property*

To conduct our analysis and come up with model that best predicts the price we analysed the data set, and selected variables that drive prices from a logical point of view and used those for our base model. From this base model we conducted statistical analysis of all the other variable looking at the correlations to prices and added variables that were correlated with prices and improved on our models. Although more variables that the 6 variables included above were correlated to prices most of them did not significantly affect the price most likely due to their own correlation to variables already in the model thus we omitted them.

In conclusion, the model that best predicts prices is  **log(price_4\_nights) = prop_type_simplified + number_of_reviews+ review_scores_rating + room_type + accommodates + neighbourhood_cleansed_simplified+ availability_30+ reviews_per_month** and it explains 52% of the variation in prices of Airbnb rentals for a 4 night stay for 2 people in Copenhagen

# Data Wrangling

## Loading the data

```{r load_data, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

# use cache=TRUE so you don't download the data every time you knit

listings <- vroom("http://data.insideairbnb.com/denmark/hovedstaden/copenhagen/2021-09-30/data/listings.csv.gz") %>% 
       clean_names()
```

**Interpretation:** Number of rows(observations): 9625; Number of
columns(variables): 74; Number of numeric variables: 37; Number of
character variables: 23; Number of date variables: 5; Number of logical
variables (factor variables): 9.

Note: logical variables have a fixed or known set of possible values,
thus they are also factor variables, for example,
host_is_superhost(TRUE/FALSE), host_has_profile_pic(TRUE/FALSE)

## Examining the raw values of the data set

```{r examining data set,cache=TRUE}
#variables / columns
dplyr::glimpse(listings)

```

## Description of variables

You can find a full [data dictionary
here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iWCNJcSutYqpULSQHlNyGInUvHg2BoUGoNRIGa6Szc4/edit#gid=982310896).
Below are the definitions of some of the most important variables:

-   `price` = cost per night in Danish krone

-   `property_type`: type of accommodation (House, Apartment, etc.)

-   `room_type`:

    -   Entire home/apt (guests have entire place to themselves)
    -   Private room (Guests have private room to sleep, all other rooms
        shared)
    -   Shared room (Guests sleep in room shared with others)

-   `number_of_reviews`: Total number of reviews for the listing

-   `review_scores_rating`: Average review score (0 - 100)

-   `longitude` , `latitude`: geographical coordinates to help us locate
    the listing

-   `neighbourhood`: three variables on a few major neighborhoods in
    each city

## Creating a clean data set

### Converting character variables to numeric variables

```{r, data wrangling}

## converting 'price' to a numeric variable
listings_clean <- listings %>% 
  mutate(price = readr::parse_number(price)) %>%

##dropping non-numeric characters before/after the first number from variable 'bathrooms'
  mutate(bathrooms_text=replace(bathrooms_text, bathrooms_text=="Shared half-bath", 0.5)) %>%  
  mutate(bathrooms_text=replace(bathrooms_text, bathrooms_text=="Half-bath", 0.5)) %>%
  mutate(bathrooms_text=replace(bathrooms_text, bathrooms_text=="Private half-bath", 0.5)) %>%

## converting 'bathrooms' to a numeric variable
  mutate(bathrooms = readr::parse_number(bathrooms_text)) 

```

### Confirming price is a numeric variable

```{r}
#check price is a number
typeof(listings_clean$price)
```

# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Computing summary statistics and finding missing values

```{r,cache=TRUE}
skimr::skim(listings)
```
\
**Interpretation:** 

We have 23 character variables that specify
information about the property hosts, such as their name, location,
response rate, picture and bio. We observe that 4 variables are related
to the neighborhood of the properties, and they have more than 4000
missing values. We can also observe that over 4000 hosts do not have
their "about" section filled. Most importantly, we see that 'price' is
in the character variable section, instead of numeric variables.

In the logical variables, we find values that have fixed or known set of
values, such as TRUE and FALSE. We observe that 4 logical variables have
9625 missing values, which implies that they are completely empty since
we have 9625 rows in total in our dataset. These variables are
neighbourhood_group_cleansed, bathrooms, calendar_updated and license.

In the numeric variables, we observe that more than 1400 values are
missing from the 5 review scores variables, which indicates that almost
15% of the tenants do not leave a review. We also see that 218
properties do not have their number of bedrooms listed, which is an
important variable for calculating the price of the property.

## Overview of variables of interest

**Note:** We are examining 5 variables of interest, namely:
1. price 
2. number of beds
3. room capacity
4. minimum nights
5. maximum nights

For now, we have chosen these variables based on their potential ability to explain
our target variable** $Y$, the cost for 2 people to stay at an Airbnb
location for 4 nights.

### Price

```{r, price}
mosaic::favstats(listings_clean$price)
```

**Interpretation:** Since mean \> median, the distribution of 'price' is
positively skewed. Minimum price is 0, which is odd because property
listings cannot be done for free.

### Number of beds

```{r, number of beds}
mosaic::favstats(listings$beds)
```

**Interpretation:** Since mean \> median, the distribution of 'beds' is
positively skewed. Minimum number of beds is 0, which is odd because
every listed property should have atleast 1 available bed. We observe
that the maximum number of beds are 25, while the median is 2, which
implies that the data is positively skewed, with outliers on the higher
side of the mean.

### Room capacity

```{r, room capacity}
mosaic::favstats(listings$accommodates)
```

**Interpretation:** Since mean \> median, the distribution of
'accommodates' is positively skewed. We want to calculate the price of 4
nights for 2 people, hence all rooms that accommodate lesser than 2
people are not of interest. We observe that minimum room capacity is 0,
and Q1 is 2, so we can conclude that we approximately exclude the first
quartile of the room capacity data in our analysis.

### Minimum nights

```{r, minimum nights }
mosaic::favstats(listings$minimum_nights)
```

**Interpretation:** Since mean \> median, the distribution of
'minimum_nights' is positively skewed. Our target variable requires
price of properties for 4 nights, thus we exclude all data with
minimum_nights requirement of more than 4 from our analysis. We observe
that maximum number of minimum_nights is 1111, which is odd because
there are only 365 in a year.

### Maximum nights

```{r, maximum nights}
mosaic::favstats(listings$maximum_nights)
```

**Interpretation:** Since mean \> median, the distribution of
'maximum_nights' is positively skewed. We need maximum_nights to exclude
properties that have maximum_nights less than 4, because our target
variable requires properties which allow stay of atleast 4 days.

## Data visualisations


### Examining Distribution of price

```{r}
listings_clean%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=price),binwidth=10)+
  geom_histogram()+
  theme_minimal()+
  ggtitle("Histogram of price")+
  NULL

listings_clean%>%
  filter(price<=3500) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=price),binwidth=10) +
  geom_histogram(alpha=0.7, colour="black")+
  theme_bw()+
  ggtitle("Histogram of price less than 3500")+
  NULL
  
```


### Exploring numerical variables of interest

```{r,exploring_variables,numerical}

library(purrr)

listings_numeric <- listings %>%
  select("minimum_nights", "maximum_nights", "review_scores_rating", "number_of_reviews")%>%
  filter(minimum_nights<=30)%>%
  filter(maximum_nights<=1600) %>%
  filter(number_of_reviews<=200)

listings_numeric %>%
  gather() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(value)) +
    facet_wrap(~ key, scales = "free") +
    geom_histogram(color="black", fill="pink")+
    theme_bw()+
    geom_density(alpha=0.5)+
    NULL
```

### Exploring factor variables using geom_bar

Logical variables that are factor variables:
1. host_is_superhost
2. host_has_profile_pic
3. host_identity_verified
4. has_availability
5. instant_bookable 

Character variables that are factor variables:
1. property_type
2. room_type
3. bathrooms_text
4. host_response_time
5. host_neighborhood

```{r,exploring_factor_variables}

# plotting bar graph of host_is_superhost
listings%>%
  filter(!is.na(host_is_superhost))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=host_is_superhost))+
  geom_bar()+
  theme_bw()

# plotting bar graph of instant_bookable 
listings%>%
  filter(!is.na(instant_bookable))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=instant_bookable))+
  geom_bar()+
  theme_bw()
```

### Exploring factor variables using geom_col

```{r, exploring_factor_variables_2}

##review_scores_rating with different host_is_superhost levels
listings%>%
  filter(!is.na(host_is_superhost))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=host_is_superhost, y=review_scores_rating))+
  geom_col()+
  theme_bw()

##number_of_reviews with different host_identity_verified levels
listings%>%
  filter(!is.na(host_identity_verified))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=host_identity_verified, y=number_of_reviews)) +
  geom_col() +
  theme_bw()

```

## Correlations

**Interpretation:**
 
The correlations between variables are surprisingly low as the numerical data fails to capture the intangible factors such as location and marketing (e.g. quality of description). The variable review_scores_location appears to explain 0.025 (2.5%) of the price and whilst this is not significant, the relationship could be explored later through a regression.
 
As seen from the chunk of code below, variables relating to reviews do not correlate with a higher price. Logically, this appears reasonable as a property, which has a high amount of ratings and high overall rating could be a low-priced property and vice versa. As a group, the relationship between the different sub-sections of ratings (e.g. review_scores_cleanliness and review_scores_communication) are surprisingly low at 0.51.
 
There are some variables, which are conditional on the value of a categorical value. For instance,  "accommodates" and "beds" have 74.6% correlation. This is sensible as clearly the "accommodates" variable is the sum of beds and structure of bedrooms. The variables, which are closest to a perfect correlation at 0.999 are "calculated_host_listings_count" and "calculated_host_listings_count_entire_homes".
 
```{r,weak_correlation}
listings_clean %>%
select(c(price, number_of_reviews,review_scores_rating,review_scores_accuracy,review_scores_cleanliness,review_scores_communication,review_scores_value,review_scores_location,reviews_per_month)) %>% #we expected these variables to be strongly correlated however they are not
  ggpairs(alpha = 0.4)
```
 
**Interpretation:** From the chunk below, we find a stronger correlation between price, accommodates, beds, bedrooms, availability_30, availability_60, availability_90, and availability_365. However, the variables in groups (1) accommodates, beds and bedrooms and (2) availability_30, availability_60, availability_90, and availability_365 are highly correlated. Therefore, we attempt to remove the noise by only selecting accommodates (15.1% correlation to price) and availability_30 (10.8% correlation to price) in the next graph.   
 
```{r,strong_correlation}
listings_clean %>%
select(c(price, accommodates, beds, bedrooms, availability_30, availability_60,availability_90,availability_365)) %>%
  ggpairs(alpha = 0.4)
```
 
**Interpretation:** Finally, we test other variables, which we do no suspect to have a great influence on price. We surprisingly find that "calculated_host_listings_count" and "calculated_host_listings_count_entire_homes" have an almost perfect correlation at 0.999.
 
```{r,test_of_random_variables}
listings_clean %>%
select(c(price, number_of_reviews,number_of_reviews_ltm, number_of_reviews_l30d,calculated_host_listings_count, calculated_host_listings_count_entire_homes,calculated_host_listings_count_private_rooms, calculated_host_listings_count_shared_rooms, reviews_per_month,)) %>%
  ggpairs(alpha = 0.4)
```

## Property types

## Examining property types

```{r, examining property types}

head(listings_clean %>%
  group_by(property_type) %>%
  summarise(count=n()) %>%
  mutate(proportion=count/sum(count)) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))
)

```

**Interpretation:** We can see that the four most common property types
are "Entire rental unit", "Entire condominium (condo)", "Private room in
rental unit", "Entire residential home". Together they account for 8,440
listings which corresponds to 87.68% of the total amount. For simplicity,
we will group the remaining \~13% of listings in the category "Other",
by creating a new variable called "prop_type_simplified".

### Creating the variable prop_type_simplified

```{r, creating the variable prop_type_simplified}

listings_prop <- listings_clean %>%
  mutate(prop_type_simplified = case_when(
    property_type %in% c("Entire rental unit","Private room in residential home", "Entire residential home","Entire condominium (condo)") ~ property_type, 
    TRUE ~ "Other"
  ))
  
```

```{r}
head(listings_prop %>%
  count(property_type, prop_type_simplified) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
)

```

**Interpretation:** From the table above we can see that all property
type categories, except for the top four ones in terms of listings, are
transformed into the category "Other" for the prop_type_simplified
variable.

### Examining the relationship between price and property type

```{r}

# barplot for property_type vs average price 

listings_prop %>%
  group_by(prop_type_simplified)%>%
  summarise(average_price = mean(price)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=prop_type_simplified,y=average_price))+
  geom_col()+
  ggtitle("Average Property Price vs Property Type")+
  geom_text(aes(label = c(1061.12,1125.19,1354.68,954.92,473.51)), vjust = 1.5, colour = "white")+
  NULL

```

**Interpretation:** The above histogram shows us the average rental
price of properties in each category of the variable
prop_type_simplified. Looking at the resulting data, we see that
properties in the type "Entire residential home" have the highest
average price (\DKK 1354.68) and "Private room in residential home" has the
lowest average price (\DKK 473.51). These observations should make
intuitive sense, as entire residential homes should costs more than a
single room in the same type of home.

```{r}

listings_prop %>%
  select(price,review_scores_rating, review_scores_location, review_scores_value,
         number_of_reviews, reviews_per_month,
         bedrooms,beds, availability_365) %>%
  ggpairs(alpha=0.5)+
  theme_bw()

```

**Interpretation:** "Review_scores_value" and "Review_scores_rating"
have the highest significant correlation of 74.1%. This result makes
sense as the two variables measure the same item, namely, the visitors'
satisfaction with the accommodation.

### Listings that are intended for travel purposes

**Questions:**\
-   What are the most common values for the variable `minimum_nights`?
-   Is there any value among the common values that stands out?
-   What is the likely intended purpose for Airbnb listings with this
    seemingly unusual value for `minimum_nights`?

Filter the airbnb data so that it only includes observations with
`minimum_nights <= 4`

```{r}

#most common value for minimum_nights
listings_prop %>%
  group_by(minimum_nights) %>%
  count(sort=TRUE)

summary(as.factor(listings$minimum_nights))
```

**Interpretation:** The most common value for "minimum_nights" among all
listings is 2 nights. Furthermore, it is quite surprising that some
listings that are intended for travel purposes require a minimum stay of
30 nights, considering that most of the countries and companies
worldwide don't even allow their employees that many vacation days. Most
likely, these Airbnb listings are intended for people who live in the
specific city only in the short-term, for example for internships, and
need an accommodation for that time period.

```{r}
#filter for data with less than 4 nights 
listings_less_than_4 <- listings_prop %>%
  filter(minimum_nights <= 4)
```

```{r}
#correlation (ggpairs with the filter for less than equal to 4 nights)
listings_less_than_4 %>%
 select(price,review_scores_rating, review_scores_location, review_scores_value,
         number_of_reviews, reviews_per_month,
         bedrooms,beds, availability_365) %>%
  ggpairs(alpha=0.5)+
  theme_bw()

```

# Mapping

## Map

```{r, out.width = '80%'}

leaflet(data = filter(listings, minimum_nights <= 4)) %>% 
  addProviderTiles("OpenStreetMap.Mapnik") %>% 
  addCircleMarkers(lng = ~longitude, 
                   lat = ~latitude, 
                   radius = 1, 
                   fillColor = "blue", 
                   fillOpacity = 0.4, 
                   popup = ~listing_url,
                   label = ~property_type)
```

```{r mapping_01}

listings%>%
  filter(minimum_nights<=4)%>%
  group_by(neighbourhood_cleansed)%>%
  count()

listings%>%
  filter(minimum_nights<=4)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=neighbourhood_cleansed))+
  geom_bar()+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=70, size=8, vjust=0.6))+
  labs(title="Distribution of Airbnb homes among neighborhoods",x="Neighbourhood",y="Count")+
  NULL

```

**Interpretation:** Looking at the map and the distribution of listings
across all neighborhoods, we can observe that, unsurprisingly, listings
are more concentrated in the city center and become more scarce the
further me move out. Indre By has the most Airbnb listings of all (1414
listings) followed by Nrrebro with 1250 Airbnb listings. 

## Relationship between price and neighbourhood

```{r mapping_1}

listings_clean_map<-listings_clean%>%
  group_by(neighbourhood_cleansed) %>%                         
  summarise_at(vars(price),              
              list(name = mean))

listings_clean_map%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=neighbourhood_cleansed,y= name))+
  geom_point()+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 70, size=8, vjust=0.6))+
  labs(title="Average rental price per night in each neighbourhood",x="Neighbourhood",y="Average price per night")+
  geom_text(aes(label = c(1000.77,1101.55,695.19,815.97,1143.60,1488.38,885.83,1071.06,921.62,841.43,1050.33)), vjust = 1.5, colour = "black")+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=70, size=8, vjust=0.6))+
  theme_bw()+
  NULL

listings_clean%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=neighbourhood_cleansed))+
  geom_boxplot(aes(y= price))+
  labs(title="Range of rental price per night in each neighbourhood",x="Neighbourhood",y="Price per night")+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=70, size=8, vjust=0.6))+
  theme_bw()+
  NULL

```

**Interpretation:** Looking at the average rental price in each neighbourhood, 
it becomes clear that Indre By is by far the neighborhood with the highest 
average rental prices (\~DKK 1490 per night). The cheapest Airbnbs, on average, are
in Bispjebjerg. When taking a look at the range of the prices in each area, we 
observe some big outliers (probably due to incorrect reporting of the 
hosts), which significantly influence the average prices.

# Setting up for Regression Analysis

To start with, our target variable will be the cost for two people to
stay at an Airbnb location for four nights.

## Creating variable 'price_4\_nights'

```{r, data cleaning}

#creating our output variable "price_4_nights"
regression_df_1 <- listings_prop %>%
  filter(accommodates >= 2, minimum_nights <= 4, maximum_nights >= 4) %>%
  mutate(price_4_nights = price*4) %>%
  filter(!is.na(price_4_nights)) # removing any missing values , but none seem to exist 

```

**Note:** To define price_4\_nights, we filtered for rooms that
accommodate *at least* 2 people (>=2) because 2 people can also stay in
a room with capacity of 3 or more people.\
\
Secondly, since our guests want to stay for 4 nights, we filtered
minimum nights *lesser or equal to 4* (<=4), because our guests can
stay at rooms with minimum nights requirements between 1 and 4.\
\
Moreover, we filtered maximum nights for *larger or equal to 4* (>=4),
because our guests have to be able to stay for at least 4 nights. The
logic behind filtering these variables for the conditions is that we
want to get rid of pricing data that is not feasible for our guest
requirements.

## Examining distribution of price_4\_nights

```{r, examining distribution of price_4_nights}

regression_df_1 %>%
  ggplot(aes(price_4_nights)) +
  geom_histogram(color="black", fill="grey")+
  theme_bw()+
  geom_density(alpha=0.5) +
  NULL

regression_df_2 <- regression_df_1 %>%
  mutate(log_price_4_nights = log(price_4_nights))

regression_df_2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(log_price_4_nights)) +
  geom_histogram(color="black", fill="pink")+
  theme_bw()+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +
  NULL

```

**Interpretation:** 

Going forward we should use log_price_4\_nights. As seen from
above, logging price_4\_nights makes the variable roughly normally
distributed. This is desirable because for running a basic OLS
regression analysis, one's input variables should be normally
distributed. Put simply, by logging the variable, we are reducing the
skewness of the variable price_4\_nights.

# Regression Analysis Part 1: Base specification

## Model 1 - Type of listing

```{r, regression model 1}

model1 <- lm(log_price_4_nights ~ 
               prop_type_simplified + 
               number_of_reviews + 
               review_scores_rating, 
             data = regression_df_2)
  
summary(model1) 
car::vif(model1)

autoplot(model1)+ theme_bw()

regression_df_2 %>%
  group_by(prop_type_simplified) %>%
  summarise(count=n())

```

**Interpretation:** 

Having run a simple OLS regression, we can see that
reviews_scores_rating is not a significant explanatory variable of
log_price_4\_nights at the 5% significance level. This can be deduced
from the relatively low t value (-0.443) and correspondingly low
p-value. Thus, when controlling for property type, reviews do not seem
to affect prices in this simple model. This seems intuitive because a
property's review score should not directly affect a listing's price but
rather the willingness of a customer to book said listing. Hence, we
would expect it to have a direct relationship with something like
occupancy rate.\
\
Moreover, we can see that all dummy variables derived from
"prop_type_simplified" are significant at least at the 5% significance
level. Thus, they all affect our dependent variable log_price_4\_nights.
This was to be expected as the size of a rental unit should be a
critical contributing factor in determining price. When interpreting the
sign of our property types we need to remind ourselves of the base case,
which is "Entire condominium (condo)". In light of this it makes sense
that "private" and "other" rooms come at a discount while "entire"
rental units and residential homes come at a premium.\
\
We also observe that "number_of_reviews" is significant at the 5%
significance level with a t-value of -2.25. However, the effect on price
appears negligible when compared to property types.

## Model 2 - Type of room

```{r, regression model 2}

model2 <- lm(log_price_4_nights ~ 
               prop_type_simplified + 
               number_of_reviews + 
               review_scores_rating + 
               room_type, 
             data = regression_df_2)
  
summary(model2) 

car::vif(model2)

autoplot(model2)+ theme_bw()


regression_df_2 %>%
  group_by(room_type) %>%
  summarise(count=n())

```

**Interpretation:**

From the above we can see that all types of room have a statistically
significant negative effect on log_price_4\_nights at the 5% level.
Private and shared room are both significant at the 1% level. The
significant effects were to be expected as the type of room (private vs.
shared) should be a big contributing factor in determining price. The
signs of our variables have to be interpreted in conjunction with our
base case. As can be seen from our room_type overview table, the base
case is "Entire home/apt", thus, it makes sense that all other room
types command a reduction in price.\
\
Moreover, as expected, adding room_type as an additional explanatory
variable changes the estimates for our other coefficients. While all
property types remain significant at the 5% level, number of reviews
becomes insignificant. Overall, when controlling for property and room
type, both review ratings and number of reviews do not significantly
affect our output variable.\
\

## Comparing Model 1 and Model 2

There are a couple of things to note here: `review_scores_rating` and
`number_of_reviews` are both relavtively insignficant across both models
and seem to only have negligble effects. Thus, they do not appear to be
an explanatory variable of `log_price_4_nights`. However, for our
subsequent analysis we will keep them as a control variable, as when
dropped into the residual they might otherwise induce omitted variable
bias. After all, beyond size and type of property, price will be most importantly 
affected by the underlying quality of the listing for which reviews tend
to be a good indicator. Thus going forward, we will keep them in our
model specification.\
\
When looking at the VIF of `prop_type_simplified` we see that it
increases significantly when introducing `room_type`. This makes sense,
since there is some overlap in these two variables in that both of them
give an indication of whether a listing is private or shared. However,
the VIF is still small and within in the acceptable range of below 5.
Moreover, our adjusted R-squared goes up by a large margin, from roughly
7% to 21%. Thus, adding `room_type` drastically improves the explanatory
power of our model, which is why will keep it as a regressor going
forward.\
\
From the residual plots for Model 1 and Model 2 we can however clearly
see that there seems to be a relationship within the data that has not been accounted
for yet. Moreover, both our scale-location show a similar clustering like
the residual plots, indicating that variability is not the same for all
levels of price. This is why we will now investigate further explanatory
variables that may or may not improve our model's explanatory power.

# Regression Analysis Part 2: Further variables

## Model 3 - Size of the listing

**Question:** Are the number of `bathrooms`, `bedrooms`, `beds`, or size
of the house (`accomodates`) significant predictors of `price_4_nights`?
Or might these be co-linear variables?

**Note:** In our data set, the number of bathrooms was not recorded
across all observations. Thus, we cannot analyse this variable Moreover,
intuitively, the number of people a listing can accommodate will closely
correlate with the listing's number of beds and bedrooms. For this we
will first estimate a regression model that includes all variables and
then investigate their relationships further through a correlation
analysis. We will then reason why we only keep one of them.

```{r, regression model_3_0}


model3_0 <- lm(log_price_4_nights ~ 
               prop_type_simplified + 
               number_of_reviews + 
               review_scores_rating +
               room_type +
               beds +
               bedrooms +
               accommodates, 
             data=regression_df_2
             )

msummary(model3_0)

autoplot(model3_0)+ theme_bw()

car::vif(model3_0)

```

```{r, correlation_size_of_listing}

regression_df_2 %>%
  select(c(accommodates, beds, bedrooms)) %>%
  ggpairs(alpha = 0.3)

```

**Interpretation:** 

Our regression that includes all 3 indicators of
size shows that `beds` is insignificant at the 5% significance level.
Moreover, when looking at the VIF, we can see that `beds`, `bedrooms` and
`accommodates` have quite high factors. We expect that by removing two out
three variables, the VIF of the remaining variable will be
significantly lower.\
\
From the correlation analysis we can see that there is a relatively
strong correlation across all three variables. This seems intuitive as
they all give an indication for the exact same thing, namely the size of the
listing. Therefore, going forward, we will will only use `accommodate` as a
proxy for size as it has the highest correlation with the other two
respective variables.

```{r,regression_model_3}
model3 <- lm(log(price_4_nights) ~ prop_type_simplified + 
               number_of_reviews + 
               review_scores_rating +
               room_type +
               accommodates, 
             data=regression_df_2
             )

msummary(model3)
car::vif(model3)
autoplot(model3)
```

**Interpretation:** 

From the regression output above, we can see that
the VIF of `accomodates` has dropped significantly. This means by remooving
`beds` and `bedrooms` it appears that we have adequately addressed potential
issues of multicolinearity. Additionally, `accomodates` is a highly
significant variable with a t-value of 39.2. This makes sense since the
price of a listing will inevitably be affected by the number of people
than stay there. The sign of impact is positive, which also seems
intuitive as one would expect a larger property to also command a higher
price.

## Model 4 - Superhosts

**Question:** Do superhosts `(host_is_superhost`) command a pricing
premium, after controlling for other variables?

```{r, regression model_4}

model4 <- lm(log(price_4_nights) ~ prop_type_simplified + 
               number_of_reviews + 
               review_scores_rating +
               room_type +
               accommodates +
               host_is_superhost, 
             data=regression_df_2
             )

msummary(model4)
car::vif(model4)
autoplot(model4)

```

**Interpretation:** 

From the above output we can see a couple of things:
First, `host_is_superhost` is not a significant explanatory variable for
price_4\_nights at the 5% significance level. Secondly, while VIF is not
showing any signs of colinerarity, R2 has not changed compared to our
latest model (model3) and the RSME even slightly increases. We also do
not see any changes in our residual and normal Q-Q plots. This all
indicates that `host_is_superhost` is not adding any new information to
the model. We also do not suspect that `host_is_superhost` accounts for
any omitted bias which would necessitate to include it as a control
variable. Overall, for the reasons above we will drop this variable going
forward.

## Model 5 - Instant bookable

**Question:** Some hosts allow you to immediately book their listing
(`instant_bookable == TRUE`), while a non-trivial proportion don't.
After controlling for other variables, is `instant_bookable` a
significant predictor of `price_4_nights`?

```{r, regression model_5}

model5 <- lm(log(price_4_nights) ~ prop_type_simplified + 
               number_of_reviews + 
               review_scores_rating +
               room_type +
               accommodates +
               instant_bookable, 
             data=regression_df_2
             )

msummary(model5)
car::vif(model5)
autoplot(model5)

```

**Interpretation:** 

From the above output we can see that
`instant_bookable` is not a significant explanatory variable for
price_4\_nights at the 5% significance level. Moreover, like for
`host_is_superhost` we do not see any improvement in the explanatory
power in our model as R2 and RMSE do not change. Given that
(`instant_bookable == FALSE`) only affects a very small fraction of our
observations, this was to be expected. Regarding colinearity, there
seems to be no significant correlation between instant_bookable and
other explanatory variables due to all GVIF values are less than 5.
Due to all this, we will not consider this variable going forward.

## Model 6 - Neighbourhoods

Determining whether location is a predictor of `price_4_nights`.

### Creating new variable neighbourhood_cleansed_simplified

```{r,regression model_6 simplied variable}

regression_df_clean_neighbourhood <- regression_df_2 %>%
  mutate(neighbourhood_cleansed_simplified = case_when(
    neighbourhood_cleansed %in% c("Indre By",
                                  "Vesterbro-Kongens Enghave", 
                                  "Nrrebro","sterbro", 
                                  "Frederiksberg", 
                                  "Amager Vest") ~ neighbourhood_cleansed, 
    TRUE ~ "Other"
  ))

regression_df_clean_neighbourhood %>%
  count(neighbourhood_cleansed_simplified) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) 

```

### Running Model 6

```{r, regression model 6}

model6 <- lm(log(price_4_nights) ~ prop_type_simplified + 
               number_of_reviews + 
               review_scores_rating +
               room_type +
               accommodates +
               neighbourhood_cleansed_simplified, 
             data=regression_df_clean_neighbourhood
             )

msummary(model6)
car::vif(model6)
autoplot(model6)

```

**Interpretation:**

Immediately we notice how compared to our current
preferred model (model3) our adjusted R2 increases by roughly 0.08 and
that our RMSE falls from 0.4221 to 0.3948. Moreover, all of our
neighborhood dummy variables are significant explanatory variables at
the 10% level.The large impact on the explanatory power of our model when adding this variable makes intuitive semse. Like with real estate, prices for accomodation will vary by region. Some neighborhoods will ask for a price premium due to their proxmitiy to the city centre, others because the neighbourhood is clean and affluent.\
\
Additionally, multicolinearity seems to be of no issue given that all
GVIF factors remain below 5 and since
`neighbourhood_cleansed_simplified` itself only has a VIF of 1.17.
Lastly, when looking at the residuals vs fitted and scale-location plots
we can see that they are almost random. This effect on our model was also to be expected given neighborhood's expalantory power and the categorical distribution across listings. For model 3, one could almost witness patterns of vertical lines. Adding information on location
has seemingly reduced a large part of these remaining patterns.\
\
Hence, going forward, model6 is now our preferred model.

## Model 7 - Availability

**Note:** `availability_30` is defined as the availability of the
listing 30 days in the future as determined by the calendar.

```{r, regression model_8}

model7 <- lm(log(price_4_nights) ~ prop_type_simplified + 
               number_of_reviews + 
               review_scores_rating +
               room_type +
               accommodates +
               neighbourhood_cleansed_simplified+
               availability_30, 
             data=regression_df_clean_neighbourhood
             )

msummary(model7)
car::vif(model7)
autoplot(model7)

```

**Interpretation:** 

We can see how compared to our current preferred model
(model6) our adjusted R2 increases even further, roughly by 0.08, and
that our RMSE falls significantly as well (from 0.3948. to 0.3651).
`availability_30` is also a significant explanatory variable at the 1%
level for price.\
\
Multicolinearity seems to be of no issue as well with GVIFs remaining
below 5 across the board. When looking at the residuals vs fitted and
scale-location plots we can see that adding `availability_30` has
further improved our model regarding the independence of error terms
assumption. Therefore, model7 is now our preferred model.

## Model 8 - Reviews per month

```{r, regression model_9}

model8 <- lm(log(price_4_nights) ~ prop_type_simplified + 
               number_of_reviews + 
               review_scores_rating +
               room_type +
               accommodates +
               neighbourhood_cleansed_simplified+
               availability_30+
               reviews_per_month, 
             data=regression_df_clean_neighbourhood
             )

msummary(model8)
car::vif(model8)
autoplot(model8)

```

**Interpretation:** 

From the above, we can see `reviews_per_month` only
marginally improves the explanatory power of our model. Computing AICs
in the following section will help us identify whether model8 should be
preferred over model7.

# Model Selection

## Summary Table

```{r,modelcompare}
library(huxtable)
huxreg(model1, model2, model3, model4, model5, model6, model7, model8, 
                 statistics = c('R squared' = 'r.squared', 
                                'Adj. R Squared' = 'adj.r.squared', 
                                'Residual SE' = 'sigma',
                                'AIC' = 'AIC'), 
                 bold_signif = 0.05
       ) %>% 
  set_caption('Comparison of models')

```

**Interpretation:** 

As we can see from the table above, our interpretations throughout have also been confirmed by the computed AICs (Akaike Information Criterions). The AIC stipulates that the best model is the one where the least amount of explanatory variables explain the greatest amount of variation. The smaller the AIC, the better. From the table above we can see that the AIC has fallen continuously as we moved from one preferred model to the next. This also helps us to identify model8 as our best overall model. 

## Model prediction

**Question:** Suppose you are planning to visit the city you have been assigned to over reading week, and you want to stay in an Airbnb. Find Airbnb's in your destination city that are apartments with a private room, have at least 10 reviews, and an average rating of at least 90. Use your best model to predict the total cost to stay at this Airbnb for 4 nights. Include the appropriate 95% interval with your prediction. Report the point prediction and interval in terms of `price_4_nights`.

```{r, prediction}
staying <- 
  
  # Create new data frame with imaginary scenario
  tibble(prop_type_simplified = "Entire rental unit", 
         number_of_reviews = 10,
         review_scores_rating = 90,
         room_type = "Private room",
         accommodates = 2,
         neighbourhood_cleansed_simplified = "Indre By",
         availability_30 =5.867413, 
         reviews_per_month = 0.9128969	
         )
                         
model_prediction <-data.frame(predict(model8, newdata = staying, interval = "prediction")) %>%
  #accounting for log transformation in price via exp() function
  mutate(price_4_nights = exp(fit)*0.16,
                CI_lower = exp(lwr)*0.16,
                CI_upper = exp(upr)*0.16) %>%
  select(-fit, -lwr, -upr)

model_prediction

```

**Interpretation:** 

For our model8, we specified to have a private room in an entire rental unit. We put number of reviews equal to 10, average review rating to 90 and accommodation to 2. We want a room in the best neighbourhood (Indre By). Also, we specified availability_30 and reviews_per_month to be equal to their respective means.\
\
Accounting for our log transformation of price and an exchange rate of currently 0.16 (Danish Krone to USD), we get an expected price_4_nights of c.2776 USD. This translates into c.694 USD per day. This is a lot, but we are renting an entire unit in the best part of Copenhagen, which is quite an expensive city in itself.\
\

## Additional Steps that might improve our analysis

Our 95% confidence interval for `price_4_nights`ranges from c.134 USD per day to c.3585 USD per day. This shows that there is still great variability in our model and hence it would need to be improved further. Most importantly, however, there will be some prices that have been recorded incorrectly on both ends, which may cause our results to be heavily skewed. This would require further investigation which, due to time constraints, was beyond the scope of this project. 

Secondly, further analysis could be done by testing the remaining variables within the dataset and see whether they improve our model's explanatory power. Also, we have not looked at any interaction between variables, for example the interaction between room type and neighborhood would be an interesting one to observe given that we would then know the effect of each room type in a specific neighborhood. Moreover, one could also introduce data from outside this current set, e.g. a dummy variable whether a hotel is within close range. 

Thirdly, this is only a very simple regression model of price. One could investigate whether estimators other than OLS would make more sense for our specific scenario. Also, if we had time series data on AirBnb prices wihtin Copenhangen, one could account for things like seasons, for example, which would allow us to determine the best time of the year to travel to Copenhagen.
